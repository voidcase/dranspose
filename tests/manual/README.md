This directory contains scripts and utilities for manual testing and experimentation with dranspose.
Why manual testing? It was added because automatic testing don't work great for testing web guis.
There is no way to write `assert looks_about_right()`.

- mprocs.yaml is to be used with [this nice little tool](https://github.com/pvolok/mprocs)
